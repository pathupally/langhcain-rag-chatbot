    Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
    
    Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that aims to create intelligent machines that work and react like humans. Some of the activities computers with artificial intelligence are designed for include:
    
    - Speech recognition
    - Learning
    - Planning
    - Problem solving
    
    Machine Learning is a subset of AI that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.
    
    The process of learning begins with observations or data, such as examples, direct experience, or instruction, in order to look for patterns in data and make better decisions in the future based on the examples that we provide.
    
    Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers (hence "deep") to analyze various factors of data. It's particularly effective for tasks like image recognition, natural language processing, and speech recognition.
